## Deep Visual: Evolving descision boundary (PyTorch)
- Trains a **2-layer MLP** on a synthetic dataset and records an **animated decision boundary** as the model learns. No external data needed.
- After running `python thrain_boundary.py`, you'll get `outputs/decision_boundary.gif` that looks like a colorful mal morphing as the network learns. View decision_boundary.gif as a preview
- You get to **watch the model carve up the plane** as it learns over epochs.
- Points are plotted over the plan so you can see where classifications fail and succeed over epochs.
